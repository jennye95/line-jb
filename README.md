Project Idea: “InstaPulse” — Real-Time Instagram Trend & Location Analytics
What it does:
    Ingests Instagram posts based on location searches, hashtags, or user handles.

    Extracts metadata: captions, timestamps, location, hashtags, mentions.

    Processes the data to find trending topics, hashtag clusters, or peak posting times in NYC or your chosen area.

    Visualizes the insights on a simple dashboard or exports to CSV for analysis.

    (Bonus!) Applies NLP to detect sentiment or categorize posts (event vs. casual vs. promo).

Why it’s cool and useful
    Your gf gets to flex data pipelines skills: extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL).

    You can play with music, art, events, and see what’s trending in real-time on Instagram.

    It’s interview-ready: shows skills in API integration, data cleaning, NLP, and visualization.

    It has tons of room to grow: add Twitter, TikTok, or NYC open datasets later.
